# Pariah Keyboard Case Files

These are the DXF files used to cut-out the case:

## Layers

* Layer 0 - The bottom, includes a cutout for the reset switch
* Layer 1 - Plexiglass layer, the screw holes are a bit larger so that a stand-off fits.
* Layer 2 - A spacer, screw holes fit a stand-off.
* Layer 3 - Keyswitch plate, screw holes are smaller and will not fit a stand-off (this is so you can avoid printing the top layers if desired)
* Layer 4 - A spacer
* Layer 5 - The top, meant to be wood.

### Layer sizes

* Layer 0 - 0.1" (2.54mm)
* Layer 1 - 0.118" (3mm)
* Layer 2 - 0.125" (3.175mm)
* Layer 3 - 0.1" (2.54mm)
* Layer 4 - 0.1" (2.54mm)
* Layer 5 - 0.15" (3.81mm)

## Stand-offs

Something like these: [uxcell Female Threaded Standoff Spacer Pillars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R1JBE7G/)

The hole the go in is 3.5mm in diameter and is 6.175mm long. Any pillar that is smaller in diameter than 3.5mm and smaller than 6.175mm in length should work (depending on the length of the screws you use).

## Screws

* M2x6mm for the bottom: [uxcell M2x6mm Thread Button Head Hex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1OD9UQ)
* M2x10mm for the top: [uxcell M2x10mm Thread Button Head Hex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AXUSN1Y)
